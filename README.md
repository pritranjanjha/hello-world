Learning is a pleasure and fortune. Learning 
that increases health and wealth is a great blessing. Peace
ensures happy learning process. A learner should be relaxed 
and nether too hungary nor too stomach full. 
I took learning of Coding to get some income opporunity on internet. Cmpetition for income is very tough in my society.
